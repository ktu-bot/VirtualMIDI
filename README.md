# VirtualMIDI

##Creating Music

This VirtualMIDI was made when i took a class on technology in music. I was intruiged by the tools we used in class and wanted to 
use one more. This virtual MIDI is modeled from the MPK AKAI Mini Play, as we were introduced one simlilarly in class. The Virtual MIDI has the 
ability to play 128 different instruments, with 25 keys and 8 drump pads already set up.
